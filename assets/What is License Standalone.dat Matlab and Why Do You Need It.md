# How to activate MATLAB with a standalone license file
 
If you have purchased a standalone license for MATLAB, you will need to activate it with a license file that contains the encrypted passcodes for the products you are licensed to use. The license file is usually named `license.dat` or `license.lic` and it is stored in a specific location depending on your operating system and MATLAB version.

To activate MATLAB with a standalone license file, you will need to follow these steps:
 
1. Log in to your MathWorks account and go to the License Center.
2. Select your license and click on the "Activate" button.
3. Choose "Download License File" and save it to your computer.
4. Copy the license file to the appropriate folder in your MATLAB installation directory. For example, on Windows, the folder is usually `C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R20XXx\licenses`, where R20XXx is your MATLAB release number.
5. If there are other license files in that folder, you can delete them or rename them with a different extension.
6. Launch MATLAB and verify that it is activated.

If you encounter any problems with the activation process, you can refer to the following resources for help:
