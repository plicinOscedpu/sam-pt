The film revolves around Baba, an atheist who questions the existence of God and his own destiny. He is a social activist who fights against corruption and injustice. He also has a love interest named Chamundeswari, a daughter of a rich businessman. One day, Baba meets an old man who claims to be a saint and gives him a divine power that can grant any wish. Baba uses this power to help people in need, but also faces challenges from his enemies and his own ego. The film explores the themes of spirituality, karma, morality and social responsibility.
 
Baba is considered to be one of Rajinikanth's most ambitious and personal films. He wrote the story and screenplay himself and also performed his own stunts. The film was made on a lavish budget of Rs. 25 crore and featured elaborate sets, costumes and visual effects. The film also had a star-studded cast that included Ashish Vidyarthi, Sujatha, Vijayakumar, Riyaz Khan, Amrish Puri and Sayaji Shinde.
 
Baba was a highly anticipated film among Rajinikanth's fans and the general public. The film's audio launch was attended by celebrities like Amitabh Bachchan, Kamal Haasan, Chiranjeevi and Mammootty. The film's trailer was also screened in theatres across Tamil Nadu. However, the film failed to meet the expectations of the audience and was declared a box office flop. The film was criticized for its weak plot, excessive violence, preachy dialogues and lack of entertainment value. Rajinikanth himself admitted that he made some mistakes in the film and refunded the losses to the distributors.
 
Despite its commercial failure, Baba has gained a cult following over the years. The film's songs, especially "Baba Kichu Kichu Thaa", "Rajyama Illai Emayama" and "Maya Maya", are still popular among music lovers. The film's dialogues, especially "Naan Yaar? Naan Yaar?" (Who am I? Who am I?), have become iconic among Rajinikanth's fans. The film's message of self-realization and social service has also inspired many people to follow their dreams and help others.
