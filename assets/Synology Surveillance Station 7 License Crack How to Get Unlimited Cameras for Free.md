## Method 1: Downgrade to DSM 6
 
One of the easiest ways to bypass the license check for Synology Surveillance Station 7 is to downgrade your DiskStation Manager (DSM) to version 6. According to a Reddit user [^1^], the online activation requirement was introduced in version 7.1-4056 of Surveillance Station, so if you downgrade to DSM 6, you can use any shared, hacked or cracked license keys without being spotted by the Synology activation server. However, this method also means that you will lose some of the advanced features and security updates of DSM 7, so proceed with caution.

## Method 2: Use Xpenology
 
Another way to bypass the license check for Synology Surveillance Station 7 is to use Xpenology, which is a custom firmware that allows you to run DSM on non-Synology hardware. Xpenology can emulate different Synology models and support various features of DSM, including Surveillance Station. However, this method also involves some risks and challenges, such as compatibility issues, data loss, warranty voiding, and legal disputes. Therefore, we recommend that you do your own research and backup your data before attempting this method.
 
To use Xpenology, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Download the latest Xpenology bootloader image from [here](https://xpenogen.github.io/xpenology_tool/).
2. Download the latest DSM .pat file from [here](https://www.synology.com/en-global/support/download).
3. Create a bootable USB drive with the Xpenology bootloader image using a tool like Rufus or Etcher.
4. Plug the USB drive into your non-Synology hardware and boot from it.
5. Find the IP address of your Xpenology device using a tool like Synology Assistant or Advanced IP Scanner.
6. Type the IP address in your web browser and follow the instructions to install DSM using the downloaded .pat file.
