Luther began his education at a Latin school in Mansfeld in 1488, where he learned the basics of grammar, logic, and rhetoric. In 1497, he moved to Magdeburg to attend a school run by the Brethren of the Common Life, a lay monastic order that emphasized personal piety and devotion. In 1501, he enrolled at the University of Erfurt, where he studied philosophy and law. He earned his bachelor's degree in 1502 and his master's degree in 1505.
  
On July 2, 1505, Luther had a life-changing experience that altered his career path. As he was returning to Erfurt from a visit to his parents, he was caught in a severe thunderstorm. Fearing for his life, he cried out to St. Anne, the patron saint of miners, and vowed to become a monk if he survived. He kept his promise and entered the Augustinian monastery in Erfurt on July 17, 1505. He was ordained as a priest in 1507.
  
Luther's monastic life was marked by intense spiritual struggle and anxiety. He was tormented by doubts about his salvation and by feelings of unworthiness and guilt. He sought relief through frequent confession, prayer, fasting, and penance, but found no peace. He also immersed himself in the study of the Bible and the writings of the church fathers. In 1508, he was sent to teach theology at the newly founded University of Wittenberg. In 1510 or 1511, he visited Rome as part of a delegation of German Augustinians and was shocked by the corruption and decadence he witnessed there.
  
In 1512, Luther received his doctorate in theology and became a professor of biblical studies at Wittenberg. He also continued to serve as a preacher and a pastor for the local congregation. He began to develop his own views on theology and salvation that differed from the official teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. He was especially critical of the practice of indulgences, which were certificates sold by the church that granted remission of temporal punishment for sins. He saw indulgences as a way of exploiting the poor and undermining the true repentance and faith that were necessary for salvation.
