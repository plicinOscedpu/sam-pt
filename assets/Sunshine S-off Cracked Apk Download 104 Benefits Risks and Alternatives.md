If you own an HTC device and want to enjoy more freedom and customization options, you might be interested in unlocking the bootloader and enabling S-OFF on your phone. Bootloader unlock allows you to flash custom ROMs, kernels, mods, and root your device, while S-OFF gives you access to write to any partition on your phone, including the ones that are normally protected by security. This can enable you to downgrade your firmware, change your region, or reset the tampered flag.
 
However, unlocking the bootloader and enabling S-OFF on HTC devices is not an easy task. You need a special tool that can bypass the security checks and grant you full control over your phone. One such tool is SunShine, a popular app that works on many modern HTC devices, such as the HTC U12+, U11, 10, M9, M8, and more. SunShine can unlock the bootloader and set S-OFF on your device in a matter of minutes, without requiring a PC or any complicated commands.

However, SunShine is not a free app. It costs $25 per device, and you need to pay every time you use it. This is because SunShine exploits a vulnerability in the HTC firmware that can be patched by updates. Therefore, SunShine needs to be constantly updated to support new devices and firmware versions. The developers of SunShine claim that they invest a lot of time and money into finding new exploits and maintaining the app, so they charge a fee to cover their costs and efforts.
 
If you are willing to pay for SunShine, you can download it from their official website[^6^]. You need to have an internet connection and root access on your device to use SunShine. You also need to enable USB debugging and unknown sources on your device settings. Once you download and install SunShine APK on your phone, you can launch it and follow the instructions on the screen. SunShine will check your device compatibility and firmware version, and then ask you to pay for the service. After you make the payment, SunShine will proceed to unlock the bootloader and set S-OFF on your device. You will see a confirmation message when the process is completed.
 
Keep in mind that unlocking the bootloader and enabling S-OFF will void your warranty and may erase your data. You should also be careful about what you flash on your device after using SunShine, as some files may brick your device or cause other issues. You should always make a backup of your data before using SunShine or any other modding tool.
 
SunShine is a powerful tool that can unlock the full potential of your HTC device. However, it comes at a price and with some risks. If you are not comfortable with paying for SunShine or using exploits on your device, you may want to look for other alternatives or stick with the stock firmware. The choice is yours.
  
If you have successfully used SunShine on your HTC device, you may be wondering what to do next. There are many possibilities and benefits of having an unlocked bootloader and S-OFF on your device. Here are some of them:

- You can flash custom ROMs that offer different features, performance, and aesthetics than the stock firmware. Custom ROMs are usually based on Android Open Source Project (AOSP) or other OEM skins, such as LineageOS, Pixel Experience, Resurrection Remix, etc. You can find many custom ROMs for your device on XDA Forums or other websites.
- You can flash custom kernels that tweak the hardware settings of your device, such as CPU frequency, voltage, governor, I/O scheduler, etc. Custom kernels can improve the battery life, performance, stability, and functionality of your device. Some popular custom kernels for HTC devices are ElementalX, SkyDragon, IceCold, etc.
- You can flash mods that add or modify certain features or functions on your device, such as sound enhancements, camera improvements, gesture controls, etc. Mods are usually flashed as ZIP files or installed as APK files. Some examples of mods for HTC devices are Viper4Android, Magisk Modules, Xposed Framework, etc.
- You can root your device and gain superuser access to the system. Rooting allows you to run apps that require root permissions, such as Titanium Backup, Greenify, AdAway, etc. Rooting also enables you to use tools that can modify the system files or settings, such as BuildProp Editor, Kernel Adiutor, etc.
- You can downgrade your firmware or change your region if you are not satisfied with the latest update or want to access different features or services. For example, you can downgrade from Android 11 to Android 10 or change your region from US to Europe. However, you need to be careful about the compatibility and security of the firmware you flash.

As you can see, there are many things you can do with an unlocked bootloader and S-OFF on your HTC device. However, you should also be aware of the risks and responsibilities that come with modding your device. You should always do your research before flashing anything on your device and follow the instructions carefully. You should also backup your data regularly and keep a stock firmware handy in case something goes wrong. Modding your device can be fun and rewarding, but it can also be frustrating and dangerous if done incorrectly.
