## How to Play Metal Slug Like a Pro
 
Metal Slug is not just a game of shooting and dodging enemies. It also requires strategy, skill, and knowledge of the game's secrets and tricks. If you want to play Metal Slug like a pro, you need to follow these tips and tricks that will help you improve your performance and score.

- Upgrade your base in the most efficient order. In Metal Slug Defense, you can upgrade your base to increase your AP production, defense, and special moves. However, you should not upgrade everything randomly. Instead, you should focus on upgrading your AP production first, then your defense, and finally your special moves[^1^]. This way, you can have more resources to deploy your units and protect your base.
- Build a fast and effective team that can cover all the bases. In Metal Slug Defense, you can choose from a variety of units to form your team. However, you should not just pick the ones that look cool or powerful. Instead, you should consider their speed, range, cost, and abilities. You should have a balanced team that can deal with different types of enemies and situations. For example, you should have some fast units that can rush the enemy base, some long-range units that can support them from behind, some heavy units that can tank damage and break through enemy defenses, and some special units that can provide buffs or debuffs[^1^].
- Know when to use the sandbag. In Metal Slug Defense, you can use the sandbag to block enemy attacks and create a temporary barrier. However, you should not use it all the time or randomly. Instead, you should use it strategically to protect your units or base from enemy fire or missiles. You should also use it to create gaps or choke points in the enemy line, where you can deploy your units or use your special moves[^1^].
- Take maximum advantage of your special moves. In Metal Slug Defense, you can use special moves that can deal massive damage or affect the battlefield in various ways. However, you should not use them whenever they are available or randomly. Instead, you should use them wisely and at the right time. You should use them when you have enough AP to deploy your units after using them, when you have a clear shot at the enemy base or units, when you need to break through enemy defenses or counter their special moves, or when you need to finish off a boss or a tough enemy[^1^].
- Upgrade your AP production at the start of each battle. In Metal Slug games, AP is the resource that allows you to deploy your units or use your weapons. However, you start each battle with a low amount of AP and a slow AP production rate. Therefore, you should upgrade your AP production as soon as possible at the start of each battle. This way, you can have more AP to deploy more units or use more weapons later in the battle[^2^].
- Rescuing POWs will make your life easier. In Metal Slug games, POWs are prisoners of war that are held captive by the enemy. You can rescue them by shooting their cages or chains. Rescuing POWs will give you various benefits such as extra points, weapons, items, health, bombs, or even allies. Therefore, you should rescue as many POWs as possible in each stage. However, be careful not to shoot them by accident or let them die by enemy fire or explosions[^2^].
- Prioritize your POW grinding to make the game go smoother. In Metal Slug Defense, rescuing POWs will also give you medals that you can use to buy new units or upgrade existing ones. However, some POWs are harder to rescue than others and some stages are more rewarding than others. Therefore, you should prioritize your POW grinding to make the game go smoother. You should focus on rescuing POWs that are easy to reach or have high medal values. You should also replay stages that have many POWs or high medal rewards[^2^].
- Bonus tips: Here are some more tips and tricks that will help you play Metal Slug like a pro:
    - Use cheats or trainers to modify the game settings and enhance your gameplay[^2^]. For example, you can use cheats or trainers to increase your lives, health, bombs, weapons, score, etc.
